Background and Ambitions

I am a graduate student of Technical Communication and Information Design of IIT.

Before my arrival in Chicago this summer, I was living in a middle-sized Chinese central city called Hefei, which is located near Yellow Mountain, the most famous scenic spot in China. Welcome all of you to my hometown.

At an early age, I accomplished my undergraduate program of biotechnology in Anhui University and then pursued a further master degree of English literature. The studies enabled me to enjoy the amazing beauty of natural creatures, rhyme and rhetoric of English poems and proses, as well as excellent narratives in novels.

After graduation, I began my professional career as a Chinese-English translator in HCRDI of CNBM, the state-owned building material corporation which has many projects established abroad. Because of my duty, I went to a couple of countries and had several periods of bitter-sweet working experiences there abroad. I am greatly impressed on Vietnam's sweet fruits, Sudan's primitive culture, Ethiopia's folk music and performances, Indonesia's tropical scenic views, as well as interesting interactions with local people, all of which constitute an unforgettable memory in my mind.

Heard of the above, you may ask: "Why are you here in America to begin with a new major, new field?"

Definitely, digital humanities is my new challenge under the increasingly networked society, which is also my ambition. Working within the industry sphere, I gradually realized that face-to-face inter-cultural communication is much more limited than technical and social networked interactions. The information field will lead and witness most of innovations and developments in world industry. So finally, regardless of hardship, I came to America to start a new life here, aiming at enhancing my expertise of digital communication and information architecture design.

The Internet and mass-media economy demonstrates that if all of us contribute a little, the human civilization will advance further to a big prosperity. With such ideal, I expect to learn the most advanced knowledge and skills for the development of digital media, and utilize those technologies to improve the quality and efficiency of our daily life and communication, flavoring it with fancy not fence.
